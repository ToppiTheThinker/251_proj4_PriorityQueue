Priority Queue Implementation

This project is a custom implementation of a priority queue in C++ using a Binary Search Tree with linked list properties.
The priority queue stores values with integer priorities and supports operations such as enqueue, dequeue, peek, and clear.

Compile the file with: g++ prqueue_main.cpp
then run the executable with: ./a.out

Features
enqueue: Add elements to the queue with a specified priority.
dequeue: Remove and return the element with the smallest priority.
peek: View the element with the smallest priority without removing it.
clear: Remove all elements from the queue.
Traversal: In-order traversal of the queue.
Copy constructor and assignment operator: Deep copy support.
Comparison operator: Check if two priority queues are equivalent.
